# Copilot / Agent Instructions (Monorepo)

- Follow Clean Architecture and DDD-lite boundaries.
- TDD/BDD first. Keep **cyclomatic complexity < 7** and functions ≤ 30 LOC.
- No secrets in code or generated files; use redaction policies and env placeholders.
- Update docs (diagrams, ADRs, READMEs) with any change to behavior.
