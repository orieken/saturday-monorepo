# Domain Dictionary

This file is the single source of truth for the **Ubiquitous Language** in the ai-assistant-dot-files ecosystem. All agents, skills, rules, and documentation MUST use exactly these terms. Do not invent synonyms.

**Rule:** When a new concept is introduced (via a new agent, skill, or rule), it MUST be added here before merging.

## 1. Core Domains (Bounded Contexts)

- **Agent Orchestration**: Coordination of specialized AI agents (or personas, on lower-tier platforms) through a sequential delivery pipeline with human checkpoints. Canonical definitions live in `shared/`.
- **Craftsmanship Governance**: Enforcement of clean code, architecture, and testing standards across all AI assistants and generated code.
- **Test Automation**: Automated verification of software quality through the Saturday Framework (E2E/UI) and Sunday Framework (API).
- **Feature Delivery**: The end-to-end lifecycle of taking a feature spec through analysis, implementation, review, and deployment.
- **Documentation Knowledge Base**: Persistent, RAG-friendly documentation that serves as context for both agents and humans.

## 2. Entities (Identifiable Objects)

| Term | Domain | Description | Synonyms to AVOID |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Persona** | `Agent Orchestration` | A context frame that shapes an AI model's identity, tone, and focus areas. A persona has no tool access and no autonomous workflow. It is a component of an Agent. Used on Tier 2/3 platforms (Cursor, Copilot, Gemini) where native orchestration is unavailable. Canonical definitions live in `shared/agents/`. | `profile`, `role` (too generic), `character` |
| **Agent** | `Agent Orchestration` | A Persona enhanced with tool access, an autonomous process, and pipeline participation. An Agent can take actions, produce Artifacts, and hand off to the next Agent in a Pipeline. Used on Tier 1 platforms (Claude Code). Canonical definitions live in `shared/agents/`. | `bot`, `assistant`, `model` |
| **Capability Tier** | `Agent Orchestration` | Classification of an AI platform's support level. **Tier 1 (Full)**: agents, skills, rules, hooks, orchestration (Claude Code). **Tier 2 (Personas + Rules)**: persona-level context and rule files, no orchestration (Windsurf, GitHub Copilot — Copilot upgraded from Tier 3 in 2026-07 once its path-scoped `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` support was confirmed). **Tier 3 (System Prompt)**: single instruction file only (OpenAI); Gemini/Antigravity is also Tier 3 by rules mechanism (single `AGENTS.md`, confirmed 2026-07-02 via live testing) but has real skill invocation on top, closer to Tier 1 on that one axis. **Cursor is a mixed profile, not a clean single tier** (confirmed 2026-07-06): `.cursor/agents/`/`.cursor/skills/` are genuinely Tier-1-equivalent (real subagent + skill loading, symlinked directly to `shared/`, zero drift) while `.cursor/rules/` remains Tier 2 (still fully inlined, no orchestration at that layer) — the granular `capabilities` object in `shared/platform-registry.json` is authoritative per capability; the single `tier` number is a rough label only. See `shared/platform-registry.json` for the full confirmed/unconfirmed breakdown. Defined in `shared/platform-registry.json`. | `level`, `grade` |
| **Skill** | `Agent Orchestration` | An executable, on-demand capability triggered by keywords or slash commands. Lives in `shared/skills/`. | `tool`, `command`, `action`, `plugin` |
| **Rule** | `Craftsmanship Governance` | A governance document that constrains agent behavior. Lives in `shared/rules/`. | `policy`, `guideline`, `standard` |
| **Team Type** | `Craftsmanship Governance` | Skelton & Pais's classification of a team's structural role: Stream-aligned, Platform, Enabling, or Complicated-subsystem. Registered per Bounded Context in `TEAM_TOPOLOGY.md`. | `team role` |
| **Interaction Mode** | `Craftsmanship Governance` | Skelton & Pais's classification of how two teams work together at a Bounded Context crossing: Collaboration, X-as-a-Service, or Facilitating. Registered per crossing in `TEAM_TOPOLOGY.md`; checked by `architect` and the `team-topology-check` skill. | `communication style` |
| **Agent Eval Case** | `Agent Orchestration` | A fixed input fixture plus a qualitative rubric used to check whether an agent's prompt still produces correct *reasoning* (not just the right section headings) after an edit. Lives in `tests/agents/<agent-name>/` (fixture + `expected-patterns.txt`, structural) and `eval-rubric.md` (qualitative), run via the `agent-eval` skill. Distinct from a unit test — the checker is an LLM reading the rubric, not a deterministic assertion. | `prompt test`, `golden file` (that term refers to the structural check only) |
| **Feature Spec** | `Feature Delivery` | A structured markdown document describing a work item. Lives in `features/`. | `ticket`, `story`, `issue`, `task` |
| **Pipeline** | `Feature Delivery` | The sequential chain of agents that processes a feature spec into shipped code. | `workflow`, `flow`, `process` |
| **Artifact** | `Feature Delivery` | A markdown document produced by an agent during pipeline execution. Persisted to `docs/features/<name>/`. Individual artifacts are legitimately named with a `-report.md` suffix per their content (`security-report.md`, `qa-report.md`, etc.) — that's a filename convention for a specific artifact type, not a synonym for the umbrella term "Artifact" itself. | `output`, `result` |
| **Feature Workspace** | `Feature Delivery` | The temporary working directory (`.claude/feature-workspace/`) used during pipeline execution. | `scratch`, `temp`, `staging` |
| **Context Manifest** | `Feature Delivery` | `context-engineer`'s output artifact: scope/boundaries, pinned files, global rules, KIs/ADRs, prior deliveries in the same Bounded Context, prune recommendations, and token budget. Lives at `.claude/feature-workspace/context-manifest.md`, structurally validated by `shared/contracts/context-manifest-contract.md`. | `context file`, `manifest` (too generic alone) |
| **Pipeline State** | `Feature Delivery` | The resumability checkpoint file (`.claude/feature-workspace/pipeline-state.json`) `deliver-feature` writes after every Checkpoint step — which agents completed, their artifact checksums, contract status. Read by `resume-pipeline` to continue an interrupted run. | `progress file`, `checkpoint` (too generic alone) |
| **Pipeline Trace** | `Feature Delivery` | The per-agent timing/status/iteration-count file (`pipeline-trace.json`, schema owned by the `pipeline-trace` skill) `deliver-feature` writes alongside `pipeline-state.json`. Read by `pipeline-retrospective` and `agent-scorecard` for cross-delivery trend analysis. Distinct from Pipeline State — one is for resuming a run, the other for analyzing many runs after the fact. | `log file`, `timing data` |
| **Feature Archive** | `Documentation Knowledge Base` | The permanent directory (`docs/features/<name>/`) where pipeline artifacts are persisted after delivery. | `output folder`, `results` |
| **Memory Registry** | `Documentation Knowledge Base` | The catalog of every durable memory source (KIs, ADRs, feature archive, lessons-learned, `DOMAIN_DICTIONARY.md`, `TEAM_TOPOLOGY.md`) with owner, portability, and retrieval-backend metadata. Lives at `shared/memory-registry.json`. Read by `search-ki`, `query-memory`, and `memory-engineer` before they act. | `memory index`, `knowledge catalog` |
| **Candidate Record** | `Documentation Knowledge Base` | A structured proposal (Source, Type, Evidence, Tags, Expiration condition) that a piece of captured knowledge should be promoted into a KI, ADR, rule change, living-doc update, or lesson. Produced by `promote-memory` (pipeline deliveries), `extract-lessons` (recurring cross-delivery patterns), or `documentation-manager` (ad-hoc sessions `promote-memory` never saw) — never written directly to `shared/knowledge/` without one. See `docs/runbooks/memory-engineering.md`'s Memory Contract. | `memory candidate`, `promotion candidate` |
| **Memory Sweep** | `Documentation Knowledge Base` | A periodic `memory-engineer` audit of the KI corpus for duplicates, overlaps, and expiration candidates, plus a `shared/memory-registry.json` accuracy check. Produces recommendations only — never deletes or merges a file without human approval. | `memory audit`, `KI cleanup` |
| **Blueprint Prompt** | `Test Automation` | A foundational prompt that establishes framework conventions for E2E or API test generation. | `template`, `boilerplate` |
| **Approval Gate** | `Craftsmanship Governance` | A mandatory human checkpoint before an irreversible action. Resets if the pending artifact is edited. | `confirmation`, `sign-off` |
| **Fitness Function** | `Craftsmanship Governance` | An automated, measurable check that verifies an architectural property in CI. | `lint rule`, `check`, `validation` |

## 5. Operations / Actions

- **Deliver**: Execute the full agent pipeline for a feature spec. Do not use "build", "run", or "process" when referring to pipeline execution.
- **Scaffold**: Deploy template files into a target project directory. Do not use "copy", "install", or "bootstrap" for this operation.
- **Persist**: Copy pipeline artifacts from the feature workspace to the permanent feature archive in `docs/features/`. Do not use "save", "export", or "archive" as verbs for this operation.
- **Critique**: The spec-writer's evaluation of a feature spec against agent readiness criteria. Do not use "review" (reserved for code-reviewer) or "audit" (reserved for dependency-auditor).
- **Profile**: The performance-engineer's diagnostic analysis of a slow system. Do not use "benchmark" (which implies measurement only, not diagnosis).
