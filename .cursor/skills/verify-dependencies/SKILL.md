## When To Use
Use this skill when reviewing code to ensure the dependency rule is respected. 
Specifically apply it to classes residing in the Entities / Domain Layer and Use Cases / Application Layer.
Do NOT use when modifying UI code or end-to-end testing frameworks.

## Context To Load First
1. `ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md`
2. `.claude/feature-workspace/architecture-notes.md` (if available)

## Process
1. Determine the files or directories to check.
   - What to do: Find the root folder of the application or the specific domain directory being modified.
   - What to produce: A list of target directories.
   - What to check: Verify targets exist.
2. Run dependency analysis.
   - What to do: Run `./.claude/skills/verify-dependencies/check.sh [target]`
   - What to produce: The console output of dependency-cruiser or equivalent checking tool.
   - What to check: Verify if the Domain layer imports anything from Use Cases, Adapters, or Infrastructure.
3. Handle dependency violations.
   - What to do: If external dependencies (e.g., `axios`, `express`, UI libraries) are imported into the Domain, you MUST REJECT the code.
   - When to pause: If complex dependency inversions require substantial architectural refactoring, pause for Architect or human approval.

## Output Format
```markdown
# Dependency Verification Report

## Violations
- `src/domain/payment.ts`: Imports from outer layer `src/infrastructure/stripe-client.ts`.

## Recommended Fixes
- Create an interface `IPaymentGateway` in the domain layer. 
- Implement `StripePaymentGateway` in the infrastructure layer. 
- Inject the dependency instead of directly importing it.
```

## Guardrails
- You MUST NOT approve code that couples core domain log to third-party frameworks or databases.
- The dependency rule (dependencies point ONLY inward) is rigid and non-negotiable.

## Standalone Mode
If `check.sh` is unavailable (e.g., `dependency-cruiser` is not installed), manually read the `import` statements at the top of all modified files. Flag any imports in `src/domain/` that reference `src/infrastructure/`, `src/adapters/`, or specific vendor libraries (like React, TypeORM, Axios).
